	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of efficient code in an algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space O(n) of input values for execution.
